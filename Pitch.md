- wrestling with constraining conventions leaving you feeling boxed in
- specialist database management and migrations woes
- expensive hosting yet performance issues on large or even simple websites
- lack of support for the latest technologies and pre-processors
- constract security risks and problems

## Welcome to DocPad. Liberating and empowering web development:
- just like your website assets, your content is written as files too, providing a familar way of doing things with several advantages
	- no database migration or curruption worries
	- use version control systems that you already use and love (git, svn, csv)
	- familar editing interfaces (sublime text, text edit, notepad, byword)
- opt-in support for all the functionality, allowing you to only use what you need to, starting from the very basics and working yourself up to limitless possibilities (eliminating the need for a 2-6 month learning period before you can create amazing things, get started like a pro right away). Such functionality includes:
	- layouts to abstract out your common headers and footers from your content
	- partials to abstact out common reusable portions of your website
	- pre-processors such as coffeescript, eco, markdown provided by plugins
	- powerful architecture, configuration and event infrastructure allowing you to facilitate any edge case that can come up, cleanly and swiftly - as well as naturally grow your website how you see fit, there are no constraints imposed on you - just a toolkit to help accelerate development
- an in-memory no-installation database that provides a NoSQL easy to use querying interface, so you can query your websites documents and assets to enable use cases such as:
	- having custom blog and content listings, with our own sorting and paging
	- or even display galleries created automatically by fetching the images related to the current document
- amazing design decisions leaves it future proof
	- being built on node.js we're fast, our models are powered by the popular backbone framework, and we work cross platform and even in the cloud
	- able to code your own admin interface such as (wordpress.com, magento, tubmlr) ontop of it, or rather any web application you wish
