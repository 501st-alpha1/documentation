## Support

### Reporting Bugs & Contributing

If you found a bug, have a suggestion or need help then let Benjamin know at DocPad's [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/balupton/docpad/issues)

If you would like to get in contact with Benajmin (perhaps join forces?!), you can reach him on Skype via the username balupton.


### Financial Support / Bookings

If you would like to provide financial support for NowPad or would like to book Benjamin to continue working on NowPad, here are the usual options:

- **Donations**<br/>Donate money to Benjamin Lupton without any expectations

- **Sponsorship via the Retainer Model**<br/>Commit Benjamin Lupton to working on NowPad for anywhere between 25 and 50 hours a month, paying him for the chosen time upfront, can be made on a once-off or a recurring basis.

If either of those sounds awesome, then reach Benjamin on Skype (username balupton) and we'll sort something out :)


## Thankyou

I (Benjamin) loves you.
