This is a listing of all the guides for DocPad (that we know about). If you're written one, be sure to add it here :)


### [Extending DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Extending)
How to write your own DocPad extensions :-)

### [Hosting a DocPad Website](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Hosting)
Goes into detail about the different ways you can host your DocPad website

### [QueryEngine API](https://github.com/bevry/query-engine/wiki/Using)
DocPad uses QueryEngine for its in-memory database. This link goes into detail about the API that is available to you when you do a `@getDatabase()` or `@getCollection('collectionName')` call inside your templates. For DocPad versions prior to 5.3, you would use `@database` and `@collections['collectionName']` instead of the getters.
