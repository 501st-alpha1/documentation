All pull requests must conform to the following criteria in order to get merged in:

- ### Single line, single change, pull requests only
	No monolithic/bundled pull requests as they are impossible to merge in due to: conflicting +1s and -1s in the same pull request, they get out of date quicker, and often conflict with other changes going on creating merge conflicts, all round leading to an impossible amount of overhead.

- ### Spelling fixes are great
	We love it when people fix these!

- ### Explain sentence changes
	Fixing grammar as well any other sentence restructuring will require a description along with the pull request on why this change is better than the original. It turns out that such changes are largely subjective, and that the original may be that way for sound reasons.

- ### No external documentation supplements yet
	We are not yet ready to add resources to community documentation and videos yet. We need to figure out the best way to present the data while avoiding common pitfalls like out of sync or conflicting documentation.
