Currently, there are two ways which DocPad can be extended:

- Plugins provide extra functionality to DocPad, and can be re-used across Skeletons
- Skeletons are essentially re-usable websites/projects/webapps that you've created with DocPad

## In regards to plugins

- [You can discover existing plugins here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Plugins)
- [You can learn to write plugins here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Writing-a-Plugin)
- [You can discover the events available to your plugins here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Plugin-Events)

## In regards to skeletons

- [You can discover existing skeletons here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Skeletons)
- To get your Skeleton during the bootstrap process of DocPad, post an issue on the [docpad-extras](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras) [issue tracker](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras/issues)

## Future

In the future, DocPad will also gain [support for themes](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/126) which can be used to change the look and feel of particular skeletons.
