Installing DocPad for the first time? Here's the steps:

1. [Install Node.js](https://github.com/balupton/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js)
2. Install DocPad
	``` bash
	[sudo] npm install -g docpad@6.0
	[sudo] docpad install
	```
3. If you want [Growl](http://growl.info/) notifications on OSX, [you'll need to install the growl command line tool](http://growl.cachefly.net/GrowlNotify-1.3.zip)
